      <h2>ABOUT HER</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox middle">
      <h3>GENRERAL</h3>
      <p>Sakuya first appeared as the Stage 5 boss in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. She appeared in Perfect Cherry Blossom as a playable character and in Imperishable Night as Remilia's partner along with being in the new fighting game Immaterial and Missing Power. Later, she appeared again as a playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody and in Touhou Hisoutensoku. She was a playable character once again in Double Dealing Character, and again in Unconnected Marketeers. <br>

<img src="sources/gallery2.gif" alt="yakusa" style="float: center; width: 10%; height: 10%;"> <br>

She essentially takes the position of managing the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Her height is "tall"; she is taller than Reimu Hakurei and Alice Margatroid but about the same height as Yukari Yakumo and Hong Meiling. She was not born in Gensokyo, and the name "Sakuya Izayoi" was given to her by Remilia Scarlet. In Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, Akyuu guessed that she might have originally been a vampire hunter. <br></p>

      <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
      <p>Her personality seems perfect and elegant, being a fairly serious person overall, as befitting of a maid. Although due to the nature of the mistress of the house, it is arguable whether she serves the role of a maid or a babysitter. Sometimes she shows a more spaced-out and airheaded side, and can be surprisingly unreliable. She's polite and pleasant towards to her mistress Remilia Scarlet and those she's close with, such as Patchouli Knowledge, while being less formal with other people. <img src="sources/gallery3.gif" alt="sayaku" style="float: right; width: 10%; height: 10%;"> She doesn't hang out with other humans or youkai too often, so they mostly see her as a demon's servant, while she does act like one from time to time. She was reprimanded by Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu for this, specially for her coldness and indifference to humans. Still, some humans will overlook this, and she sometimes stands in as an incident resolver, mostly when it's somewhat in her mistress's interest or interest of the mansion. For example, she worked with Reimu and Marisa to catch a sake-stealing beast. When the Miracle Mallet's magic affected one of her knives in Double Dealing Character, she became more open to the idea of using her knives. Even when she realized that the magic was taking advantage of a weakness in her heart, she decided to keep a sword filled with that magic and use it, which could indicate that she has a more bloodthirsty side. <br></p>

      <h3>ABILITIES</h3>
      <p>She can manipulate time and throw knives.</p>
